# Practice Portfolio

This is a practice developer portfolio built while following a Traversy Media tutorial.  
It's an early version I'm using to learn HTML, CSS, and basic portfolio design.

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Font Awesome

## Notes
This is not my final portfolio for job applications â€” just a learning project.
